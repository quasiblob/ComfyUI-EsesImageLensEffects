# Eses Image Lens Effects

## Description

The **'Eses Image Lens Effects'** node is a multipurpose node for ComfyUI designed to simulate a variety of lens characteristics. It combines several typical effects into a single, convenient node, allowing to add realistic or stylistic lens distortion, chromatic aberration, post-process scaling, and a highly configurable vignette.

üí° This node uses **scikit-image** and **PyTorch** for its calculations.

üí° If you are looking for a node that does many lens effects in one node, then why not give this one a try!

## Features

* **Lens Distortion & Chromatic Aberration**:
    * A **`k1_master_distortion`** control sets the primary barrel (bulge) or pincushion (squeeze) distortion for the entire image.
    * Channel-specific **`aberration`** spinners for Red, Green, and Blue act as offsets to the master distortion, creating controllable color fringing.
    * A global **`radial_exponent`** parameter fine-tunes the distortion's profile, controlling how quickly the effect ramps up from the image center outwards.

* **Post-Process Scaling**:
    * A **`post_process_scale`** slider allows for quick, centered zooming of the image.
    * This is suitable for cleanly cropping out the black areas or stretched pixels revealed at the edges by the lens distortion effect.

* **Flexible Vignette**:
    * A flexible vignette effect applied as the final step.
    * **`vignette_amount`**: Controls the intensity for both darkening (positive values) and lightening (negative values).
    * **`vignette_size`**: Adjusts the radius of the vignette, allowing it to cover more of the image or shrink into the corners.
    * **`vignette_falloff`**: Controls the hardness of the vignette's gradient curve.
    * **`fit_vignette_to_frame`**: A toggle to keep the vignette perfectly circular or stretch it to fit the image's aspect ratio.

* **Flexible Edge Handling & Quality**:
    * **`interpolation_mode`** for selecting resampling quality (e.g., Bilinear, Bicubic).
    * **`fill_mode`** to define how new pixels are handled at the boundaries.

## Installation

1.  **Navigate to your ComfyUI custom nodes directory:**
    ```
    ComfyUI/custom_nodes/
    ```

2.  **Clone this repository (or place files manually):**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/quasiblob/ComfyUI-EsesImageLensEffects
    ```

3.  **Install requirements (If needed):**
    * You likely already have `scikit-image` installed. If not, you can run the following command inside this node's directory:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Restart ComfyUI:**
    * After restarting, the **"Eses Lens Effects"** node will be available in the **"Eses Nodes/Image Adjustments"** category.

## Usage

The node is designed to be used in a logical order:

1.  Connect your image to the 'image' input.
2.  Adjust the **Distortion & Aberration** parameters to achieve the desired lens warp and color fringing.
3.  Use the **`post_process_scale`** slider to zoom in and re-frame the image, hiding any unwanted edges created by the distortion.
4.  Finally, apply a stylistic **Vignette** using its dedicated controls.
5.  Set the general `interpolation_mode` and `fill_mode` to control quality and edge handling.
